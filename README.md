* All courses have a separate folder under Student_Files so they can exist side-by-side.
* Each lab folder has a number and a name, to remind you of what the lab was about.
* The Labs folder is an empty space to do your work.
* You can always copy the solution of a previous lab as the starting point for a new lab.

## Running the Solutions

The solutions are all Java 12 Maven projects.
This course is all about the tests, so we focus on those.
Import each solution as a Maven project into IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, build, and run the tests.
